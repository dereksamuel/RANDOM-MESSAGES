# RANDOM MESSAGES

Whenever I start a new project, I don't know what to write for the first commit. After doing a “git init” there is technically nothing there...

## Install

npm install -g RANDOMMESSAGE

# Usage
  ```js
    RANDOMMESSAGE
  ```

## Contributing
If someone wants to add or improve something, I invite you to collaborate directly in this repository: [random-msg](https://github.com/dereksamuel/RANDOM-MESSAGES)
